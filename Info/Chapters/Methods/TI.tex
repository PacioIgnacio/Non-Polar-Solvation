\subsection{Free Energy Calculations}

As it is mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:TI}, The free energy difference ($\Delta G$) between two states A and B, can be calculated using Equation \ref{eq:TI}. This equation includes all the potential interactions present in the system. In this case, there are two sources of energy interactions: peptide-peptide (P-P), peptide-solvent (P-S) and solvent-solvent (S-S) interactions. (Notice that the coulomb interactions does not contribute to the Hamiltonian because each atom's charge present in the peptide, were set to 0). 
\begin{equation}
    \left \langle \frac{\partial H}{\partial\lambda} \right \rangle^{vdw}_{\lambda} = \left \langle \frac{\partial H}{\partial\lambda} \right \rangle^{vdw}_{P-P} + \left \langle \frac{\partial H}{\partial\lambda} \right \rangle^{vdw}_{P-S}.
    \label{eq:dHdl_pp}
\end{equation}
Both terms in Equation \ref{eq:dHdl_pp} contributes to the total numerical result of the free energy change between the states A and B, but, the main objective of this work is to calculate only the \textbf{free energy of forming the dry cavity} generated by the non-polar interaction ($\Delta G^{vdw}$) of the solvated solute. Taking this into account, the therm $\left \langle \frac{\partial H}{\partial\lambda} \right \rangle^{vdw}_{P-P}$ does not contribute to generate the cavity because only consider the interaction between it self, so it must be unchanged during the $\lambda$-transition, i.e, the van der Waals \textbf{peptide-peptide} interactions must remain unchanged during the process. 
This was obtain by adding an extra block (\texttt{LAMBDAS}) to the molecular dynamics input file (\textbf{*.imd}) which control the interaction between the coupling parameter $\lambda$, and the groups previously define (Sec. \ref{subsubsec:sim_box}). This allows to determine that the parameter only affects the peptide-solvent interaction, groups (1-2). Figure \ref{fig:StateAB} represent this phenomenon.

\subsubsection{Thermodynamic Integration's Numerical Error}\label{subsubsec:TIerror1}
To compute the free energy between state A and B, the integrate curve over all $\lambda$-steps must be calculated. For each value of $\lambda$, every $\frac{\partial H}{\partial \lambda}$ in the soft-core potential form (Sec. \ref{subsubsec:softcore}) is computed. To avoid numerical errors related to the smoothness of the curve generated, and further numerical integration, the transition over the $\lambda$-points must assure that the function generated by Equation \ref{eq:TI} is smooth enough to prevent this.
This is accomplish by simulate more $\lambda$-points in between other to generate more $\frac{\partial H}{\partial \lambda}_i$ values for the curve. In this case, five versions of TI were preformed to determine the total number of $\lambda$-steps: $[10,17,20,23,32]$. Al five versions are attached to this work in \ref{subsec:TI_evolve}. As a result of that, the $\lambda$ space, between 0 and 1 were distribute in 32 discrete points:

For each window, 0.2 $[ns]$ of equilibration was performed, followed by 15 $[ns]$ of production MD, from which the free energy diï¬€erences between adjacent $\lambda$ values were computed with the methods outlined above, and the total free energies were calculated by integrate the curve over all the $\lambda$-steps.
