Computation based on molecular models is playing an increasingly important role in biology, biological chemistry, and biophysics. Since only a very limited number of properties of bio-molecular systems is actually accessible to measurement by experimental means, computer simulation can complement experiment by providing not only averages, but also distributions and time series of any definable quantity, for example, conformational distributions or interactions between parts of systems. As it's mentioned in section \ref{subsec:computation}, computer modeling of bio-molecular systems has become a standard technique to study and describe the properties and behaviour of such systems in terms of interactions between atoms or electrons of atoms.

Molecular dynamics (MD) is a \textbf{computer simulation method} for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic ``evolution" of the system. Computer simulations can then be used to test and validate theories and models or to replicate and compare experimental results.

There are some key elements that must be taken into account when developing any simulation exercise. The model approximations must be consider to ensure applicability to the system of interest, and appropriate statistical analyses must be performed (for which sufficient sampling is required).

In general, to set-up a particle based simulations, there are four main choices to consider for the model that will be used which will be discussed in the next four sections as it's shown in Figure \ref{fig:md_cicle}: The degrees of freedom to be considered, interactions that occur between the chosen degrees of freedom, how they are to be sampled, and how the boundaries and/or external forces of the system are to be considered \cite{van2006biomolecular}.
