As it is mentioned in Section \ref{sec:MD}, interactions between a solute molecule and a surrounding solvent are of fundamental importance across chemistry, biology, and associated fields of science and engineering. Fully atomistic, explicit-solvent MD simulations provide an accurate and chemically detailed understanding of these interactions therefore they can be can be highly demanding in the consumption of computational resources. This cost is is associated with the large number of solvent molecules required to model a bulk solution. In practical situations, a large fraction of the time is spent calculating a detailed trajectory of the solvent molecules, even though it is primarily the solute behavior that is of interest.

Because of this, it is desirable to develop different approaches in which the influence of the solvent is incorporated \textbf{implicitly}. Approximate schemes treating the solvent implicitly can provide useful quantitative estimates and remain computationally inexpensive \cite{roux1999implicit} \cite{zacharias2003continuum}.
