\subsection{Life is based on chemical interactions}

Understanding the basis of any biological phenomena is inseparable from understanding the principles that govern the behavior of atoms and molecules. All biological functions depend on events that occur at the molecular level. These events are directed, modulated, or detected by complex biological machines, which are themselves large molecules or clusters of molecules. Included are proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and complexes of them. Many areas of biological science focus on the signals detected by these machines or the output from these machines.

Most of biological processes happens in solution, mostly water, with tightly regulated concentrations of ions such as sodium and chloride. These solvent molecules strongly influence the structure and function of molecules, affecting protein folding and stability, as well as the affinity and specificity with which bio-molecules bind.
