As we know, molecules are composed of atoms, which are the units of matter that correspond to the elements in the periodic table. For example, only a few of these elements are abundant in cells. In fact, the vast majority of biological matter, about 99\% is made of just six elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus \cite{museums1992introduction}. Molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, are made out of carbon as it's main backbone.\par

Atoms, in turn, are composed of particles known as protons, neutrons, and electrons. The properties of each particle is shown in Table \ref{table:massandcharge}. Protons and neutrons reside in the atomic nucleus and account for almost all of the mass of the atom. The number of protons present in an atomâ€™s nucleus, its atomic number (Z), determines the identity of that atom as an element.

\subsubsection{Atomic Structure: Bohr's Model}

Presented by Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford in 1913, the Bohr's Model offers a representation of how electrons orbits around the nucleus of an atom. The electron orbits into shells:  The first shell contains 2 electrons, while the next shell can hold 8 electrons. The arrangement of electrons around the atomic nucleus is complex, and electrons do not simply orbit the nucleus as a planet would orbit a star. Broadly speaking, electrons are located in concentric shells that surround the nucleus. The shells that are closer to the nucleus are generally lower in energy than the shells that are farther from the nucleus, meaning that placing an electron in a shell that is closer to the nucleus is more stable and more favorable than placing an electron in a shell that is farther from the nucleus. Because of this, electrons fill shells from the inside to the outside. Electrons in atoms with few electrons are in shells close to the nucleus, whereas atoms with many electrons first utilize the shells that are closer to the nucleus and then those that are farther from the nucleus once the inner shells are filled. 

\subsubsection{Atomic Structure: Quantum Mechanics}

Electrons don't travel in neat 2D circular orbits as the Bohr's model suggest, in fact we can't even determine the position and the velocity of an electron. Instead, we can make predictions about electron's general locations in 3D space. These regions that we call \textbf{orbitals} are the locations in space that has about 90\% certainty that an electron is located somewhere within that region \cite{brown2016introduction}. In Figure \ref{fig:orbitals} are represented the shapes that orbitals can take around the atom. Each orbital now can hold two electrons. In the case of carbon, we focus on the \textit{"s"} orbital, which are spherical in shape with the nucleus of the atom at the center, and \textit{"p"} orbital, which have the shape of the number eight, or the infinity symbol with the nucleus also at the center.

In the ground state, electrons will occupy the lowest energy orbitals first. In the case of the element \textbf{carbon}, which contains 6 electrons on it's outer shell, the first orbital that fill is the \(1s\), which an hold 2 electrons. Next, is the \(2s\)-orbital which is a larger sphere, and can also hold 2 electrons. Finally, we have \(3p\)-orbital: each one aligned along the \(x,y\) and \(z\)-axis , each capable of 2 electrons so they are filled with one electron in the \(px\)-orbital and one in the \(py\)-orbital. To be stable, carbon wants to fill these three p orbitals with 2 electron each. 

The interaction between different atom's orbitals results in ``connections" between them and can be thinking of forces of attraction (or in some cases repulsion). There are two types of interactions: \textbf{bonded} and \textbf{non-bonded} interactions. The first is know as  chemical bonds, and there are three types: (1) \textit{Ionic bond}, formed when one atom donates valence electrons to another atom. (2) \textit{Covalent bond}, when both atoms share pairs of valence electrons, and (3) \textit{Metallic bond}, formed between a cloud of free electrons and the positively charges ions in a metal. interact. For example, a water molecule is made of one oxygen atom connected to two hydrogen atoms through single covalent bonds.  However, some covalent bonds involve the sharing of more than one pair of electrons between atoms.  Double and triple bonds involve the sharing of four and six valence  electrons,  respectively.   This  versatility  allows  carbon  to  create  many  different kinds of molecules which gives this particular element, a vast number of properties. 

The second interaction, \textbf{non bonded}, is explain in detail in Section \ref{subsec:FF} because is the main objective of this work. Study the behavior of a particular component of this type of interaction.
